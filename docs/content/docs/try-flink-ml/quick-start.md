# Quick Start

This document provides a quick introduction to using Flink ML. Readers of this
document will be guided to submit a simple Flink job that trains a Machine
Learning Model and use it to provide prediction service.



## Prerequisite

Flink runs on all UNIX-like environments, i.e. Linux, Mac OS X, and Cygwin (for Windows). 

## Download & Compile Flink ML

TODO: Modify this section after Flink ML's binary distribution is released
